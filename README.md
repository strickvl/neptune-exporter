# Neptune Exporter

Neptune Exporter is a CLI tool to move Neptune experiments (version `2.x` or `3.x`) to disk as parquet and files, with an option to load them into MLflow or Weights & Biases.

## What it does

- Streams runs from Neptune to local storage. Artifacts are downloaded alongside the parquet.
- Skips runs that were already exported (presence of `part_0.parquet`), making exports resumable.
- Loads parquet data into MLflow or W&B while preserving run structure (forks, steps, attributes) as closely as possible.
- Prints a human-readable summary of what is on disk.

## Requirements

- Python `3.13`, managed via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
- Neptune credentials:
  - [API token](https://docs.neptune.ai/api_token/), set with the `NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN` environment variable or the `--api-token` option.
  - [Project path](https://docs.neptune.ai/projects), set with the `NEPTUNE_PROJECT` environment variable or the `--project-ids` option.
- Target credentials when loading:
  - MLflow tracking URI, set with `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` or `--mlflow-tracking-uri`.
  - W&B entity and API key, set with `WANDB_ENTITY`/`--wandb-entity` and `WANDB_API_KEY`/`--wandb-api-key`.

## Quickstart

### 1. Export Neptune data to disk (core):

  ```bash
  uv run neptune-exporter export \
    -p "my-org/my-project" \
    --exporter neptune3 \
    --data-path ./exports/data \
    --files-path ./exports/files
  ```

#### Export examples

Export everything from a project:  
```bash
uv run neptune-exporter export -p "workspace/proj" --exporter neptune3
```

Export only parameters and metrics from runs matching a pattern:
```bash
uv run neptune-exporter export -p "workspace/proj" --exporter neptune3 -r "RUN-.*" -c parameters -c metrics
```

Export specific attributes by pattern:
```bash
uv run neptune-exporter export -p "workspace/proj" --exporter neptune3 -a "metrics/accuracy" -a "metrics/loss" -a "config/.*"
```

Export with Neptune `2.x` client, splitting data and files to different locations:
```bash
uv run neptune-exporter export -p "workspace/proj" --exporter neptune2 --data-path /mnt/fast/exports/data --files-path /mnt/cold/exports/files
```

### 2. Inspect what was exported:

  ```bash
  uv run neptune-exporter summary --data-path ./exports/data
  ```

### 3. (optional) Load into a target:

  ```bash
  # MLflow
  uv run neptune-exporter load \
    --loader mlflow \
    --mlflow-tracking-uri "http://localhost:5000" \
    --data-path ./exports/data \
    --files-path ./exports/files

  # W&B
  uv run neptune-exporter load \
    --loader wandb \
    --wandb-entity my-org \
    --wandb-api-key "$WANDB_API_KEY" \
    --data-path ./exports/data \
    --files-path ./exports/files
  ```
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > MLflow and W&B only accept integers. If your Neptune steps contain decimals, use the `--step-multiplier` option to convert the step values to integers. Pick a single multiplier (e.g. `1000` for millisteps) and use it consistently for all loads so that every series stays aligned.
  > Default is `1` (no scaling).

## Data layout on disk

- Parquet path:
  - Default: `./exports/data`
  - One directory per project, sanitized for filesystem safety (digest suffix added) but the parquet columns keep the real `project_id`/`run_id`.
  - Each run is split into `run_id_part_<n>.parquet` (Snappy-compressed). Parts roll over around 50 MB compressed.
- Files path
  - Default: `./exports/files`
  - Mirrors the sanitized project directory. File artifacts and file series are saved relative to that root.
  - Kept separate from the parquet path so you can place potentially large artifacts on different storage.

### Parquet schema

All records use `src/neptune_exporter/model.py::SCHEMA`:

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `project_id` | `string` | Neptune project path, in the form `workspace-name/project-name`. |
| `run_id` | `string` | Neptune run identifier.<ul><li>Neptune `3.x`: User-chosen or auto-generated, stored in `sys/custom_run_id`.</li><li>Neptune `2.x`: Auto-generated `sys/id`, e.g. `SAN-1`.</li></ul>  |
| `attribute_path` | `string` | Full attribute path. For example, `metrics/accuracy`, `metrics/loss`, `files/dataset_desc.json` |
| `attribute_type` | `string` | One of: `float`, `int`, `string`, `bool`, `datetime`, `string_set`, `float_series`, `string_series`, `histogram_series`, `file`, `file_series` |
| `step` | `decimal(18,6)` | Decimal step value, per series/metric/file series |
| `timestamp` | `timestamp(ms, UTC)` | Populated for time-based records (metrics/series/file series).  Null for parameters and files. |
| `int_value` / `float_value` / `string_value` / `bool_value` / `datetime_value` / `string_set_value` | typed columns | Payload depending on `attribute_type` |
| `file_value` | `struct{path}` | Relative path to downloaded file payload |
| `histogram_value` | `struct{type,edges,values}` | Histogram payload |

## Export flow

- Runs are listed per project and streamed in batches. Already-exported runs (those with `part_0.parquet`) are skipped so reruns are resumable.
    > [!WARNING]
    > Use this with care: if a run was exported and later received new data in Neptune, that new data will not be picked up unless you re-export to a fresh location.

- Data is written per run into parquet parts (~50 MB compressed per part), keeping memory usage low.
- Artifacts and file series are downloaded alongside parquet under `--files-path/<sanitized_project_id>/...`.

> [!NOTE]
> A run is considered complete once `part_0.parquet` exists. If you need a clean re-export, use a fresh `--data-path`.

## Loading flow

- Data is streamed run-by-run from parquet, using the same `--step-multiplier` to turn decimal steps into integers. Keep the multiplier consistent across loads when your Neptune steps are floats.
- **MLflow loader**:
  - Experiments are named `<project_id>/<experiment_name>`, prefixed with `--name-prefix` if provided.
  - Attribute paths are sanitized to MLflow’s key rules (alphanumeric + `_-. /`, max 250 chars).
  - Metrics/series use the integer step. Files are uploaded as artifacts from `--files-path`.
  - MLflow saves parentship/fork relationships as tags (no native forks).
- **W&B loader**:
  - Requires `--wandb-entity`. Project names derive from `project_id`, plus optional `--name-prefix`, sanitized.
  - String series become W&B Tables, histograms use `wandb.Histogram`, files/file series become artifacts. Forked runs from Neptune `3.x` are handled best-effort (W&B has limited preview support).
- If a target run with the same name already exists in the experiment or project, the loader skips uploading that run to avoid duplicates.

## Experiment/run mapping to targets

- **MLflow:**
  - Each unique `project_id` + `sys/name` pair becomes an MLflow experiment named `<project_id>/<sys/name>` (prefixed by `--name-prefix` if provided).
  - Runs are created inside that experiment using Neptune `run_id` (or `custom_run_id` when present) as the run name. Fork relationships are ignored by MLflow.
- **W&B:**
  - Neptune `project_id` maps to the W&B project name (sanitized, plus optional `--name-prefix`).
  - `sys/name` becomes the W&B group, so all runs with the same `sys/name` land in the same group.
  - Runs are created with their Neptune `run_id` (or `custom_run_id`) as the run name. Forks from Neptune `3.x` are mapped best-effort via `fork_from`; behavior depends on W&B's fork support.

## Attribute/type mapping (detailed)

- **Parameters** (`float`, `int`, `string`, `bool`, `datetime`, `string_set`):
  - MLflow: logged as params (values stringified by the client).
  - W&B: logged as config with native types (string_set → list).
- **Float series** (`float_series`):
  - Both targets: logged as metrics using the integer step (`--step-multiplier` applied).
  - Timestamps are forwarded when present.
- **String series** (`string_series`):
  - MLflow: saved as artifacts (one text file per series).
  - W&B: logged as a Table with columns `step`, `value`, `timestamp`.
- **Histogram series** (`histogram_series`):
  - MLflow: uploaded as artifacts containing the histogram payload.
  - W&B: logged as `wandb.Histogram`.
- **Files** (`file`) and **file series** (`file_series`):
  - Downloaded to `--files-path/<sanitized_project_id>/...` with relative paths stored in `file_value.path`.
  - MLflow/W&B: uploaded as artifacts. File series include the step in the artifact name/path so steps remain distinguishable.
- **Attribute names**:
  - MLflow: sanitized to allowed chars (alphanumeric + `_-. /`), truncated at 250 chars.
  - W&B: sanitized to allowed pattern (`^[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*$`); invalid chars become `_`, and names are forced to start with a letter or underscore.

## Summary command

The `uv run neptune-exporter summary` command reads parquet files and prints counts of projects and runs, attribute type breakdowns, and basic step stats to help you verify the export before loading.
